# SCARA Drawer

This piece of software makes (or will make, as it's a WIP) [SCARA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCARA) robotic arm draw shapes defined by splines. Made in C for STM32 microcontroller (not yet integrated).

(Drawer as the thing that draws, not like a containter with an arm. Not the best name, tbh)

## Why SCARA

Cartesian would be better, but SCARA is cooler, and it's most of all a fun project.

## Inner machinations

TODO, for now just follow comments in [main.c](main.c).

## TODO
- make TODO list
